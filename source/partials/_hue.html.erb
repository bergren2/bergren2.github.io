<h2>Hue Am I? <span class="wip">[WIP]</span></h2>
<p>
<em>Hue Am I?</em> started out as a color game idea Jason Shanmugham wanted to
  try building for a game jam. Together with Sean Cusick and featuring music by
  Tom Berg, we cranked out <em>Hue Am I?</em> using <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>,
  <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a>, and <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We are currently targeting a December 2014 release for iPhone, and plan to develop
  Android in the future.
  My primary role has been styling the app from mockups, device testing on iOS,
  and hooking up sound & music.
