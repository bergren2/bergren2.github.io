<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>
  Below are some of the projects I've worked on over the years, starting with
  the most recent. The projects with the "WIP" tag are currently being developed and are
  subject to change. There are additional projects featured on GitHub and 1GAM that
  are not listed on this page.

<h2>Hue Am I? <span class="wip">[WIP]</span></h2>
<p>
<em>Hue Am I?</em> started out as a color game idea Jason Shanmugham wanted to
  try building for a game jam. Together with Sean Cusick and featuring music by
  Tom Berg, we cranked out <em>Hue Am I?</em> using <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>,
  <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a>, and <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We are currently targeting a December 2014 release for iPhone, and plan to develop
  Android in the future.
  My primary role has been styling the app from mockups, device testing on iOS,
  and hooking up sound & music.

<h2>Baby Tanks <span class="wip">[WIP]</span></h2>
<p>
  <em>Baby Tanks</em> started as a group of friends trying to learn how to use the
  <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> game engine. After using a random game jam
  theme generator to give us the theme "baby tanks", Tom Berg, TJ Jacobs, Tom Patterson,
  and I began work on our first physics-based game. Later TJ and I would continue
  to work on the game in an upcoming jam, adding newcomer Steve Pikelny to our roster.
</p>
<p>
  With <em>Baby Tanks</em>, I have been tasked with creating the art -- definitely
  not my strongest skill. However I contribute code when I'm not figuring out how
  to draw trees, and I've worked with Tom Berg on choosing and hooking up the music
  and various sound effects in the game.
</p>
<p>
  This game is not currently scheduled for release, but we would like to get it into
  a semi-playable state sometime in the near future.

<h2>&lt;it's a metaphor for death&gt;</h2>
<p>
  This game won the <a href="http://igdachicago.com/chicago-2013-game-jam/">2013 IGDA Chicago Game Jam</a>,
  and is one of my favorite works. Tom Berg, Kevin Folk, TJ Jacobs and I created
  this game over a 48-hour period. We used the <a href="http://craftyjs.com/">Crafty</a>
  JavaScript game engine for the final game.
</p>

<p>
  For this game I was once again the game designer and off-and-on coder. I hooked
  up sound & music, and worked on making the user experience as beginner-friendly
  as possible. I even added a bit of a hack that saved us from an embarrassing bug
  during our presentation when the player would occasionally spawn inside a wall.

<h2>Fork It!</h2>
<p>
  <em>Fork It!</em> was an entry to the first <a href="https://github.com/blog/1303-github-game-off">GitHub Game Off</a>,
  and our first non-scholarly foray into creating games. Sean Cusick, TJ Jacobs,
  Tom Patterson, and I got together to create this game. It's certainly not our best
  work, but the experience taught us a lot about making games and working as a team.
</p>
<p>
  My primary role on this project was the game designer -- I created the mechanics
  and premise for the game. I also worked on graphics and some level design. It was
  through this project that we learned the importance of sound. We used the <a href="http://craftyjs.com/">Crafty</a>
  JavaScript game engine.
