  <h2>My Hearthstone Collection <span class="wip">[WIP]</span></h2>
<p>
  I threw together this site to publicly display the <a href="http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/">Hearthstone</a>
  cards in my collection. I'm currently working on adding search functionality and
  might try to integrate with <a href="https://trackobot.com/">Track-o-Bot</a> at
  some point in the future.

  <h2>Hue Am I?</h2>
<p>
<em>Hue Am I?</em> started out as a color game idea Jason Shanmugham wanted to
  try building for a game jam. Together with Sean Cusick and featuring music by
  Tom Berg, we cranked out <em>Hue Am I?</em> using <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>,
  <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a>, and <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>.
</p>
<p>
  My primary role has been styling the app from mockups, device testing on iOS,
  and hooking up sound &amp; music.

  <h2>&lt;it's a metaphor for death&gt;</h2>
<p>
  This game won the <a href="http://igdachicago.com/chicago-2013-game-jam/">2013 IGDA Chicago Game Jam</a>,
  and is one of my favorite works. Tom Berg, Kevin Folk, TJ Jacobs and I created
  this game over a 48-hour period. We used the <a href="http://craftyjs.com/">Crafty</a>
  JavaScript game engine for the final game.
</p>

<p>
  For this game I was once again the game designer and off-and-on coder. I hooked
  up sound &amp; music, and worked on making the user experience as beginner-friendly
  as possible. I even added a bit of a hack that saved us from an embarrassing bug
  during our presentation when the player would occasionally spawn inside a wall.
</p>

  <h2>Fork It!</h2>
<p>
  <em>Fork It!</em> was an entry to the first <a href="https://github.com/blog/1303-github-game-off">GitHub Game Off</a>,
  and our first non-scholarly foray into creating games. Sean Cusick, TJ Jacobs,
  Tom Patterson, and I got together to create this game. It's certainly not our best
  work, but the experience taught us a lot about making games and working as a team.
</p>
<p>
  My primary role on this project was the game designer -- I created the mechanics
  and premise for the game. I also worked on graphics and some level design. It was
  through this project that we learned the importance of sound. We used the <a href="http://craftyjs.com/">Crafty</a>
  JavaScript game engine.

  <h2>Fantasy Football Legacy League <span class="wip">[WIP]</span></h2>
<p>
  The Fantasy Football Legacy League -- or #FFLegacy for the social media aficionado
  in each of us -- is a fantasy football league I started in 2014. I wanted to create
  a long-lasting league where owner history could be analyzed and referenced year
  after year.
</p>
<p>
  This year I've focused on collecting the data from Yahoo and making it accessible
  as CSVs for the other owners who don't know how to program (a majority). In the
  off-season I plan to throw together a website and provide basic analytics tools
  as requested by others in the league.
